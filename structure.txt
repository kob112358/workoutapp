SWAGGER - for endpoints/APIs
OAuth
Access Code (Authorization Code Grant) - App has a backend
Application (Client Credentials Grant) - only when User & App are the same entity (app has limited usage as it only serves one user)
Implicit - works best if the App is a single-page app or a native mobile app
Password - last resort, only if App & OAuth Server belong to the same entity


PASSPORT - for authentication
